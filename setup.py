LONG="""
It's like `os.walk`, but backwards... and on a bicycle.

## Core Features

- Walk directories up, down, or both directions
- Search for files, directories, or both item types
- Return first item found immediately, or list of all matching items
- 100% Test Coverage (pytest)
- 100% PEP8 Compliant (pep8, autopep8)

## Motivation?

The primary use case for Backpedal is finding files from within your current directory, and/or parent(s).  For example, both Vagrant and Fabric support running from nested sub-directories within a project while loading their associated `Vagrantfile` or `fabfile.py` from the root (parent) project directory by searching from the current directory and upward.
